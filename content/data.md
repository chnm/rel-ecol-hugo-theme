### Denominations in the U.S. Censuses of Religious Bodies

This dataset contains a list of the denominations (or other religious groupings) used by the U.S. Census Bureau in the federal Census of Religious Bodies. Included are the denominations listed in the 1906, 1916, 1926, and 1936 censuses. The same denomination will appear in different census years. Not all denominations will appear in each year, because the Census Bureau changed with denominations it counted each decade, but also because denominations split, merged, were formed, or were dissolved from decade to decade.
