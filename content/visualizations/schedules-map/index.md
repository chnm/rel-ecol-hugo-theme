          <p><small>Using data from the published records of the U.S. Census of Religious Bodies, this map shows the number of congregations or members for a specific denomination, represented by a yellow circle, in major cities. You can also view the data for all the congregations within a denomination family, or for every kind of religious group counted by the Census Bureau. The larger the circle, the more churches or members were located in that area. Users can hover over the circle to see more information, including the number of congregations and area denominational membership. The map currently features the data from the 1926 census, and data from other censuses will be added later. The “Select a denomination family” box allows users to choose a specific denomination family to see what denominations are included. The “Select a denomination” box allows the user to choose which denomination will be featured in the map. Click on a point to zoom into that region; click anywhere else to zoom back out.</small></p>
