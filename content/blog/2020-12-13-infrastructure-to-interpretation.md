In June 2020, one of the historians on our project was asked to give at talk to the "Digital History and Hermeneutics" master class at the University of Luxembourg. Since this talk was produced on YouTube rather than live, due to the pandemic, we're offering it to you here. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjsOerR9ZSM) offers a behind-the-scenes look at how we are digitizing, transcribing, visualizing, and interpreting the data from the 1926 Census of Religious Bodies.
