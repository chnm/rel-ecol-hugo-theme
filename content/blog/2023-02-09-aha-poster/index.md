For the 2023 annual meeting of the American Historical Association, a [large contingent from RRCHNM](https://rrchnm.org/news/rrchnm-at-the-aha/) presented papers or posters. That included some of the American Religious Ecologies project team, who presented a poster about our project and zealously handed out materials about the project to passersby (which included a few of our advisory board members). 

You can [download our poster](/blog/american-religious-ecologies-at-aha-2023/relec-aha-poster.pdf) from the conference as a PDF.

And for good measure, here are some of our team members at the AHA.
