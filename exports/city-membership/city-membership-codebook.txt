Description: This dataset contains the membership data for denominations (or other religious groupings) grouped by city. Included are the cities data listed in the 1906, 1916, 1926, and 1936 censuses. Note that in addition to the number of congregations and total membership, the census bureau in some years reported membership data broken down by age (over or under 13 years old) and in other years by sex (male and female).

Fields:

- year (integer): The census year for which this data was gathered.
- city (text): The name of the city.
- state (text): A two-letter code for the state of the city.
- denomination (text): The name of the denomination as most commonly used by the Census Bureau.
- denomination_id (text): A code, usually three digits, that the Census Bureau assigned to identify denominations. For example, "Primitive Baptists" are represented by `0-2-3`. This data is available for most (not all) denominations in the 1926 census, but not for other years. 
- churches (integer): The number religious congregations in that denomination, city, and year.
- members_total (integer): The total number of members reported across congregations for that denomination, city, and year.
